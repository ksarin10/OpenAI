For example, pseudorandom generators at first could only be constructed from a specific hard problem, such as discrete log IBM2]. Later it was shown how to construct pseudo-random generators given any one-way permutation [Y], and from other weak forms of one-way functions [Le, GKL]. Finally JILL] proved that the existence of any one-way function was a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of pseudo-random generators. Similarly, the existence of trapdoor permutations can be shown to be necessary and sufficient for secure encryption schemes."
